                            Transportation: Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, 
                            though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow 
                            Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small 
                            airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes.
                            Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets 
                            will be able to land on the island within the next few years.

                            Ground Transportation: Public buses serve Taniti City and run 
                            from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest 
                            of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental 
                            cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport. 
                            Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors 
                            (helmets are required by law). Taniti City is fairly flat and 
                            very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding 
                            Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
