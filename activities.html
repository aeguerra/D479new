                            Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano. However, there 
                            are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on 
                            chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting 
                            several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing 
                            a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, 
                            and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. 
                            Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly 
                            developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.

                            <br>Most tourists spend most of their time in Taniti City, which boasts 
                            native architecture and nearby white, sandy beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay. 
                            Other popular activities include boat or bus tours of the island, hikes in the 
                            rainforest, or visits to Tanitiâ€™s active volcano.
